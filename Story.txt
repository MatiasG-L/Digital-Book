Imagine, if you will, the silence of
 nature, well mostly silence that is.
 The silence is only interrupted by a 
river, with a steady stream of water.
 The sound of the water splashing against
 rocks, a cool breeze caresses you taking 
away every worry you may have. Let’s focus
 on that for a second. It's a funny thing, 
the wind. It travels where it pleases, 
 does what it desires, with not a care. 
Some days it's calm, and others its temper
 is short. Resembling a living being.
Now the wildlife have awoken, chirping, 
seeming as to not have any other place to 
be or thing to do. Other lifes soon follow,
 and begin their daily activities, continuing 
the cycle of 
nature, but not for long.
Soon, something horrible will come, 
unbeknownst to this community. Something
 so terrible that the fate of this place 
could be changed, forever.
But let’s back up for a minute. Where
 are we, how did we get to this point,
 and what might this horrid thing that
 will come you may ask? Well, in due time 
these inquiries of yours will be answered
 my friend.
Lets jump to another place, on the other 
side of the planet. Here, a small village
 with little huts placed within the hills, 
seemingly part of the world itself. They are a
 bountiful community with farms, shops, and halls
 lined with treasurers from their perilous journeys.
 It is the only society in this area, no neighbors
 but the fauna around them. Oh my, I forget to 
mention the name of said tiny utopia,
 this is the Village of Mooglik.
